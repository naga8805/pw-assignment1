-- Answer:
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id     INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    emp_name   TEXT NOT NULL,
    age        INT CHECK (age >= 18),
    email      TEXT UNIQUE,
    salary     DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 30000
);


/* Q2: 2. Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provide
 examples of common types of constraints.*/

-- Answer:
/* Constraints are rules enforced on data columns in a table to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database, a concept known as data integrity.
 Here are some common types of constraints:

 NOT NULL: Ensures a column cannot have a NULL value. This is useful for columns that must always have a value, like a customer's name.
 UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are different. While a PRIMARY KEY is always UNIQUE, you can have multiple UNIQUE constraints in a table. For example, a social security number or email address should be unique for each record.
 PRIMARY KEY: A column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. A table can only have one PRIMARY KEY. It's a combination of UNIQUE and NOT NULL.
 FOREIGN KEY: A key that links two tables together. It references the PRIMARY KEY of another table, ensuring referential integrity by preventing actions that would destroy links between tables. For example, you can't delete a customer if there are still orders associated with their ID.
 CHECK: Ensures all values in a column satisfy a specific condition. For instance, you can use a CHECK constraint to ensure that an age column only contains values greater than or equal to 18.*/

/* Q3: Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column?
 Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify your answer.*/
 
-- Answer:

/* You apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column when you need to guarantee that every row in the table will have a value for that column.
 This prevents missing or unknown data in fields that are essential for the integrity of the data, such as a user's name or an item's description.
 A primary key cannot contain NULL values. This is a fundamental rule of relational database design.
 A primary key is designed to uniquely identify each record in a table, and a NULL value represents missing or unknown data.
 If a primary key could be NULL, it would be impossible to guarantee a unique identity for that record, which defeats the entire purpose of a primary key.*/

-- Q4: 4. Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. 
-- Provide an example for both adding and removing a constraint.

-- Answer:
/* You can add or remove constraints from an existing table using the ALTER TABLE statement.
Adding a Constraint: You use ALTER TABLE with the ADD CONSTRAINT clause.
Example: To add a UNIQUE constraint to the email column in a table named users:*/

ALTER TABLE users
ADD CONSTRAINT UC_users UNIQUE (email);

/*Removing a Constraint: You use ALTER TABLE with the DROP CONSTRAINT clause.
Example: To remove the UNIQUE constraint named UC_users from the users table:*/

ALTER TABLE users
DROP CONSTRAINT UC_users;

/* Q5: Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints.
Provide an example of an error message that might occur when violating a constraint.*/

-- Answer:

/* Attempting to perform an operation (like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) that violates a constraint will cause the database to reject the action and return an error.
 The operation will not be completed, and the data in the table will remain unchanged.
 This mechanism is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing invalid or corrupt data from being stored.
Example of an error message:
If you try to insert a duplicate value into a column with a UNIQUE constraint, the database will raise an error similar to this:

ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry 'test@example.com' for key 'users.email'

This specific message indicates a Duplicate entry error, which happens when you attempt to insert a value that already exists in a column with a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint.*/

/*Question 6. You created a products table without constraints as follows:

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2));
    
Now, you realise that?
: The product_id should be a primary keyQ
: The price should have a default value of 50.00*/

-- Answer:
ALTER TABLE products
ADD PRIMARY KEY (product_id);
ALTER TABLE products
ALTER COLUMN price SET DEFAULT 50.00;

/* Q7: You have two tables:

 NORMALISATION & CTE
********************************************************************/

/* Q 1. First Normal Form (1NF)
a. Identify a table in the Sakila database that violates 1NF 
and explain how you would normalize it to achieve 1NF.*/

-- Answer;

/* In the Sakila sample database, the ADDRESS table can be viewed as violating 1NF
 if we choose to store multiple phone numbers for a single address inside one column
 (for example: a column "phones" that stores values like '555-1111,555-2222').
 1NF requires that each attribute contain only atomic (single) values and that there
 are no repeating groups.

 Normalization to 1NF:*/
-- Step 1: Create a new table to hold each phone number as a separate row.

CREATE TABLE address_phone (
    address_id INT NOT NULL,
    phone      VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (address_id, phone),
    FOREIGN KEY (address_id) REFERENCES address(address_id)
);

-- Step 2: Remove the non-atomic "phones" column from ADDRESS (if it existed).

ALTER TABLE address
DROP COLUMN phones;

/* Step 3: Insert each phone number as a separate row into address_phone.
 Now each field in every table holds a single, indivisible value,
 satisfying the requirements of First Normal Form.*/



/* Q 2. Second Normal Form (2NF):
 a. Choose a table in Sakila and describe how you would determine whether it is in 2NF. 
If it violates 2NF, explain the steps to normalize it.*/

-- Answer:
/* 2NF Definition:
A table is in 2NF if:
   (1) it is already in 1NF, AND
   (2) every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent
   on the whole primary key (no partial dependency on part of a composite key).

- Example from Sakila:
 Consider a hypothetical design of the FILM_ACTOR table where
   PRIMARY KEY (film_id, actor_id) and suppose it also contains columns like film_title or actor_first_name.

 Problem:
  film_title depends only on film_id (part of the composite key),
  actor_first_name depends only on actor_id.
 These are partial dependencies â†’ the table violates 2NF.

 Steps to normalize to 2NF:
 1. Remove the non-key columns that depend on only one part of the composite key.
 2. Place them in separate tables where the primary key matches their natural dependency.*/

-- Implementation:

-- Create separate tables (if not already existing):
CREATE TABLE film (
    film_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title   VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    -- other film-specific columnsâ€¦
);

CREATE TABLE actor (
    actor_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
    last_name  VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL
    -- other actor-specific columnsâ€¦
);

-- Keep the junction table only for the many-to-many relationship:
CREATE TABLE film_actor (
    film_id  INT NOT NULL,
    actor_id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (film_id, actor_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (film_id)  REFERENCES film(film_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (actor_id) REFERENCES actor(actor_id)
);

/* Now every non-key attribute depends on the whole primary key in its own table,
 and the relationship table contains no partial dependencies, satisfying 2NF.*/


/* Question 3. Third Normal Form (3NF):
 a. Identify a table in Sakila that violates 3NF. Describe the transitive dependencies 
  present and outline the steps to normalize the table to 3NF.*/

-- Answer:
/* 3NF Definition:
 A table is in 3NF if:
   (1) it is already in 2NF, AND
   (2) every non-key attribute depends only on the primary key,
       not on another non-key attribute (no transitive dependency).

 Example from Sakila:
 Imagine we design the CUSTOMER table like this (hypothetical extra column):
   customer_id  (PK)
   first_name
   last_name
   address_id
   city_name        <-- violates 3NF
   country_name     <-- violates 3NF

 Transitive dependency:
   city_name and country_name depend on city_id/country_id,
   which in turn depend on address_id, not directly on customer_id.
   So: customer_id â†’ address_id â†’ city_name / country_name
   This is a transitive dependency and breaks 3NF.

Steps to normalize to 3NF:
 1. Remove the non-key columns that depend on another non-key column.
 2. Place those columns in separate tables keyed by their own determinants.

 Implementation (already present in the official Sakila schema):
   â€¢ CITY table holds city_name and a foreign key to COUNTRY.
   â€¢ COUNTRY table holds country_name.
   â€¢ ADDRESS table holds city_id.
   â€¢ CUSTOMER table holds address_id.*/

-- Correct 3NF structure:

CREATE TABLE country (
    country_id   INT PRIMARY KEY,
    country      VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE city (
    city_id      INT PRIMARY KEY,
    city         VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    country_id   INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (country_id) REFERENCES country(country_id)
);

CREATE TABLE address (
    address_id   INT PRIMARY KEY,
    address      VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    city_id      INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (city_id) REFERENCES city(city_id)
);

CREATE TABLE customer (
    customer_id  INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name   VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
    last_name    VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
    address_id   INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (address_id) REFERENCES address(address_id)
);

/* After separating city and country into their own tables,
 all non-key attributes in CUSTOMER depend only on customer_id,
 and transitive dependencies are removed â€” the design is now in 3NF.*/


/* Q 4. Normalization Process:
 a. Take a specific table in Sakila and guide through the process of normalizing
 it from the initial unnormalized form up to at least 2NF.*/
 
 -- Answer

/* Example Table:  Suppose we start with an UNNORMALIZED table called CUSTOMER_ORDERS
 (this is a hypothetical denormalized design for illustration):

 UNNORMALIZED FORM (UNF)
 -------------------------------------------------------
 customer_id | customer_name | phones               | film_titles
 ------------|-------------- |--------------------- |------------------------------
 1           | John Smith    | 555-1111,555-2222    | "Matrix,Avatar"
 2           | Mary Jones    | 555-3333             | "Titanic"
 -------------------------------------------------------
 Problems:
  â€¢ Multiple phone numbers in one column (repeating group)
  â€¢ Multiple film titles in one column (repeating group)

 Step 1: First Normal Form (1NF)
 Requirement: Eliminate repeating groups; each field must be atomic.

 Solution:
  â€¢ Create separate rows for each phone number.
  â€¢ Create a separate table for the many-to-many relationship of customers to films.*/

CREATE TABLE customer (
    customer_id   INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE customer_phone (
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    phone       VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id, phone),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customer(customer_id)
);

CREATE TABLE customer_film (
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    film_id     INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id, film_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customer(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (film_id)     REFERENCES film(film_id)
);

/* Now each column contains atomic values and the design satisfies 1NF.

Step 2: Second Normal Form (2NF)
 Requirement: Already in 1NF and every non-key attribute
 must be fully dependent on the entire primary key.

Potential issue:
   In the customer_film table, suppose we also added a column customer_name.
   customer_name depends only on customer_id (part of the composite key),
   not on the whole (customer_id, film_id).
   This is a partial dependency and violates 2NF.

 Solution:
   Remove customer_name from customer_film and keep it only in the customer table,
   so that all non-key attributes depend on the whole key.

 After removing the partial dependency, the schema is in 2NF.

 Summary:
   UNF  -> 1NF : removed repeating groups (phones, film_titles).
   1NF  -> 2NF : removed partial dependency by placing customer_name only in customer table.*/
