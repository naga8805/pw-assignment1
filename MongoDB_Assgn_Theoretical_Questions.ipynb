Data is often stored in flexible structures like JSON-like documents (e.g., MongoDB). |\n",

        "A **replica set** is a group of MongoDB servers (nodes) that maintain the same data set:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  * Handles all **write operations** and, by default, read operations.\n",

        "#### 5. **Backup & Disaster Recovery**\n",
        "\n",

        "* **Allowed Values:** The `$in` operator restricts a field to a specific list of values (like an enum).\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1. **Sharding (Automatic Data Distribution)**\n",
        "\n",
        "* MongoDB supports **sharding**, which splits large datasets across multiple servers (shards).\n",
        "* Each shard holds a portion of the data → enables **parallel processing** and avoids bottlenecks.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Traditional relational databases struggle with massive datasets.\n",
        "* MongoDB’s sharding allows collections to grow **beyond a single machine’s storage limits**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **High Availability with Replica Sets**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Each shard can itself be a **replica set**, ensuring both **scalability and redundancy**.\n",
        "* Even if one node fails, another replica takes over.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Improved Read & Write Performance**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Queries can be distributed across shards.\n",
        "* **Writes** are balanced, preventing overload on a single server.\n",
        "* **Reads** can target specific shards (via shard keys) instead of scanning all data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Elastic Growth**\n",
        "\n",
        "* You can add new shards (servers) as your data grows, without downtime.\n",
        "* This means **cost-effective scaling** — you don’t need expensive high-end hardware; instead, you can use multiple commodity servers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Geographical Distribution**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Shards can be deployed in **different data centers or regions**.\n",
        "* Enables **low-latency access** for global applications (e.g., users in Asia connect to Asian data centers, users in Europe to European servers).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Support for Diverse Workloads**\n",
        "\n",

        "##  What is MongoDB’s WiredTiger Storage Engine?\n",
        "\n",
        "* **WiredTiger** is the **default storage engine** for MongoDB (since version **3.2**).\n",
        "* A **storage engine** is the component that manages how data is stored on disk and in memory, and how read/write operations are handled.\n",
        "* WiredTiger replaced the older **MMAPv1** engine, offering **better performance, scalability, and compression**.\n",
        "\n",
        "##  Key Features of WiredTiger\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Document-Level Concurrency Control**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Uses **document-level locking** instead of collection-level locks (used in MMAPv1).\n",
        "* Multiple clients can update different documents in the same collection **without blocking each other** → much higher throughput.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Compression**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Supports **data and index compression** to save storage space.\n",
        "* Default: **Snappy compression** (fast, moderate compression).\n",
        "* Optional: **zlib compression** (higher compression, lower speed).\n",
        "* Benefit → reduces disk usage and improves cache efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Checkpointing & Journaling**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Uses **write-ahead logs** (journals) to ensure **data durability**.\n",
        "* Performs **periodic checkpoints** so that only a small set of data needs to be replayed in case of crash recovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Memory Management**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Efficient use of **RAM and caching**.\n",
        "* Uses a **cache eviction strategy** to keep frequently accessed data in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **High Performance**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Optimized for both **read-heavy and write-heavy workloads**.\n",
        "* Well-suited for **real-time analytics, IoT, and large-scale apps**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "##  Why is WiredTiger Important?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Performance** → Document-level concurrency allows many users to read/write simultaneously.\n",
        "2. **Efficiency** → Compression saves disk space and reduces I/O.\n",
        "3. **Reliability** → Journaling and checkpoints protect against crashes.\n",
        "4. **Scalability** → Supports modern, large-scale applications handling massive datasets.\n",
        "5. **Default Choice** → Since MongoDB 3.2, WiredTiger is the default, making it the backbone of most modern MongoDB deployments."
